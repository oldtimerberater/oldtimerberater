# **THE 5-PLATFORM MINIMAL IDENTITY SET**

These five together are the smallest footprint that still creates a stable entity in Google’s Knowledge Graph.

## **1. LinkedIn — personal profile**

This is non-negotiable. Google heavily trusts LinkedIn for identity.

**You must include:**

* Name: **Andrey Paymushin**
* Role: **Founder / CEO**
* Industry: “Automotive (classic cars) / Sourcing”
* Website: **[https://oldtimerberater.eu/](https://oldtimerberater.eu/)**
* Same “preview image” as on your site
* Short description matching your JSON-LD

---

## **2. Google Business Profile (Service-Area Business)**

This is REQUIRED if you want Google to treat you as a **LocalBusiness/AutomotiveBusiness**.

You do **not** need:

* A storefront
* Hours of walk-in service
* Public address

Google supports “Service Area” businesses.

**Enter:**

* Same name
* Same address (even if hidden)
* Same phone
* Same hours as JSON-LD
* Same preview image
* Same category: **Automotive Consultant** or **Auto Broker** (closest to what you do)

---

## **3. Crunchbase — company page**

People underestimate this one.
Crunchbase feeds directly into business identity systems and is high-authority.

**Include:**

* Business name (your brand or your personal name — choose one and stick with it)
* Same URL
* Same description (shortened version is fine)
* Same image (upload it)

---

## **4. X (Twitter) — minimal profile**

You don’t need to post anything.

**Set:**

* Display name: **Andrey Paymushin**
* Handle: something close (e.g. @apaymushin)
* Bio line: “Oldtimer & parts sourcing”
* URL: **[https://oldtimerberater.eu/](https://oldtimerberater.eu/)**
* Same preview image or a consistent avatar

---

## **5. About.me OR Medium (choose one)**

These are extremely simple entity-confirmation hubs.

### Option A: About.me

* Put your full name
* 1 sentence description
* Your website
* The same image

### Option B: Medium

Publish a 1-paragraph article titled:

> “Oldtimer & Parts Sourcing — Andrey Paymushin”

Include:

* Your name
* What you do
* Link to your website
* Optionally your image

---

# **Internal alignment rules (CRITICAL)**

To create an entity, Google must see **the same fact repeated on 5 different sites**:

### All 5 profiles must consistently use:

* **Exact same name**
* **Exact same URL**
* **Exact same phone**
* **Exact same email**
* **Exact same city**
* **Exact same image**
* **Exact same role/title**
* “Oldtimer & parts sourcing” phrasing (do not reword)

If even 1 profile introduces inconsistencies → the entity collapses.

---

# **How Google connects these**

The flow looks like this:

1. Google crawls each of the five domains
2. It extracts:

   * “Who is this?”
   * “Where do they work?”
   * “What site do they own?”
3. If **3+** sources repeat the same identity → entity candidate
4. If **5** sources repeat it → stable entity
5. Knowledge Graph entry is created
6. Knowledge Panel **may** appear when users search your name or brand

This process takes 4–12 weeks.

---

# **If you want**

I can now produce the **one-week operational plan** (step-by-step, one platform per day), with:

* Exact text you should paste into each profile
* Exact formatting
* The precise image filename
* All identity fields
* Link structure

This guarantees that Google sees a perfectly aligned identity cluster.
